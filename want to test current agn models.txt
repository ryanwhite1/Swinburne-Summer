want to test current agn models
read papers and analyse methods
eventually want to reproduce some models 

look what disc profiles are used in the literature
both for the agn gas and stellar distribution
look at star formation around agn

shmuel gilbaum - the effect of thermal torques on AGN disc migration traps 
	- could use this for analytic agn profile
yang 2019 - agn disks harden the mass distribution of stellar mass binary black hole mergers

peters equations for GW emission
surfinBH code 


semi major axis at which two objects become bound relates to their keplerian orbit velocity and the velocity dispersion at that point in the disk - if dispersion higher, systems are unstable
