 - eccentricity damping doesn't appear as effective as in Amy's paper
	- would Amy be willing to take a look at the code?
 - the migration does look about right, but need to clarify the theta vector direction
	- the peak in the torques is ~2 orders of mag below the peak in Bellovary (2016) though!
 - should ask what nbody code they used and if its open source/available
 - open to collaboration if interested
